![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/human-trafficking.jpg)

Built an interactive webpage to explore the nature of human trafficking globally. Some of the key takeaways include:

1. Network map showing human trafficking routes globally;

2. Hot spot maps that show the density of human trafficking events globally with poverty rates as tile layers;

3. Interactive scatter plot of frequency of human trafficking events and country demographics; 

4. Gauge plot showing TIER ranking of each country according to the 2018 TIP report;

5. Word cloud of the most frequent words associated with human trafficking in each country;

6. Bar charts and gauge tanks to show frequency of human trafficking events by days and months;

7. Map of conflicts related to human trafficking events in each country weighted by number of fatalities;

8. Data page to allow users interract with the dataset used to build the charts.

The gauge chart, world cloud, map of conflicts , bar charts and gauge tanks were updated any time that a new country is selected via a dropdown.
